🐍 Week 1 – Python Basics | Personal Introduction Program
📌 Internship Week 1 Project

This repository contains my Week 1 internship project, focused on learning Python fundamentals.
The goal of this week was to understand basic programming concepts and build a simple interactive Python program.

📚 What I Learned (Week 1)
🔹 Python Basics

What programming is and why Python is beginner-friendly

How Python code runs step-by-step

🔹 Core Concepts

Variables – storing data like numbers and text

Data Types – integers, strings

Basic Math Operations – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Strings – working with text data

Lists – storing multiple values in a single variable

Input & Output – using input() and print()

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Editor: VS Code / Any Python editor

Optional: Google Colab (for browser-based execution)

🎯 Project Description
📌 Personal Introduction Program

A simple Python program that:

Asks the user for their name

Asks for their age

Asks for their favorite hobby

Displays a friendly welcome message using the provided information

🧪 How the Program Works

Takes user input using input()

Stores input values in variables

Displays the information using print()

▶️ Sample Code
# Personal Introduction Program

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
hobby = input("Enter your favorite hobby: ")

print("\n--- Personal Introduction ---")
print("Hello,", name + "!")
print("You are", age, "years old and your hobby is", hobby + ".")
print("Nice to meet you 😊")

💻 Sample Output
Enter your name: Shahul
Enter your age: 20
Enter your favorite hobby: Coding

--- Personal Introduction ---
Hello, Shahul!
You are 20 years old and your hobby is Coding.
Nice to meet you 😊
