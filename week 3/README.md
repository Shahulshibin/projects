📊 Week 3: Introduction to Data Analysis – Working with Real Data
📌 Overview

In Week 3, the focus is on understanding the fundamentals of data analysis using Python and Pandas.
This week introduces working with real datasets, exploring data structure, cleaning missing values, and extracting meaningful insights such as totals, averages, and best-selling products.

🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, I was able to:

Understand what data analysis is and why it is important

Use the Pandas library for Excel-like operations in Python

Load data from CSV / Excel files

Explore datasets using built-in Pandas functions

Identify and handle missing values

Perform basic statistical calculations

Analyze a simple sales dataset and generate a basic report

📚 Theory Concepts Covered

What is Data Analysis and its real-world importance

Introduction to Pandas and DataFrames

Reading data from CSV and Excel files

Exploring datasets (head(), info(), shape, describe())

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Simple statistics: sum, average, maximum, minimum

🛠️ Hands-On Practice

The following tasks were performed as part of the practice:

Installed Pandas using pip

Created and loaded a simple sales dataset

Displayed the first few rows of the dataset

Checked dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)

Identified and handled missing values

Calculated basic statistical values

📂 Dataset Used

A simple sales dataset containing:

Product name

Quantity sold

Price per unit

Example:

PRODUCT,QUANTITY,PRICE
Notebook,2,50
Pen,10,5
Pencil,5,2

🧪 Project: Simple Sales Data Analysis
Objectives:

Calculate total quantity sold

Identify average and highest prices

Generate a basic summary report

Key Operations:

Created derived columns

Used aggregation functions like sum(), mean(), max()

Cleaned data and ensured correct data types

🧠 Key Learnings

Pandas makes data handling faster and easier than manual calculations

Understanding data structure is crucial before analysis

Clean data leads to accurate insights

CSV files are ideal for beginner-level data analysis

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python 3

Pandas

Excel / CSV files

VS Code / Command Line

💡 Tips & Resources

YouTube: “Pandas for absolute beginners”

Practice with small datasets (<100 rows)

Use real-life data like expenses or study hours

Debug errors using documentation and simple explanations

✅ Conclusion

Week 3 provided a strong foundation in data analysis using Python.
This knowledge prepares me for advanced topics such as data visualization and machine learning in upcoming weeks.
