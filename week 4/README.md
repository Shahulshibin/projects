📊 Week 4 – Data Visualization & Weather Data Analysis Project
📌 Overview

Week 4 focuses on understanding data visualization and applying it in a complete data analysis workflow.
In this week, I worked on a Weather Data Analysis Project using Python to load, clean, analyze, and visualize real-world style data.

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using charts and statistical analysis.

📚 Concepts Covered

Importance of data visualization

Introduction to Matplotlib

Bar charts for category comparison

Line charts for trend analysis

Data cleaning using Pandas

Basic statistical analysis

End-to-end data analysis workflow

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data handling and cleaning

Matplotlib – Data visualization

CSV Dataset

📁 Dataset

File: weather.csv
The dataset contains monthly weather information including:

Average Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Rainfall (mm)

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Checked for missing values

Handled null values using mean imputation

Verified data types and consistency

📊 Visualizations Created

Line Chart – Monthly Average Temperature Trend

Bar Chart – Monthly Rainfall Distribution

Line Chart – Monthly Humidity Levels

Each chart includes proper titles, axis labels, and grid formatting for clarity.

🔍 Key Analysis & Insights

Identified the hottest and coldest months

Analyzed rainfall patterns across the year

Observed seasonal humidity trends

Generated descriptive statistics for all numerical columns

Example insights:

May recorded the highest average temperature

December experienced the highest rainfall

Humidity levels increased during monsoon months



▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the files

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib


Run the Python file:

python weather_analysis.py


View the generated charts and insights

🎯 Learning Outcome

By completing this project, I learned how to:

Visualize data effectively

Perform basic data cleaning

Extract insights from datasets

Present analysis in a professional manner

Build confidence in end-to-end data analysis

🚀 Conclusion

This project marks my first complete data analysis project, combining theory and practical implementation.
It strengthened my understanding of data visualization and how insights can be communicated clearly using charts.
