# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location. The project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the basics of Machine Learning
- Learn supervised learning using regression
- Implement Linear Regression from scratch
- Train models using scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Visualize predicted vs actual house prices

## 📊 Dataset Description
