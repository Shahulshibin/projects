# 📘 Week 2: Making Decisions & Repeating Tasks in Python

This week focuses on teaching Python how to **think, decide, and repeat tasks** using conditions, loops, and functions. By the end of Week 2, you will be able to write interactive programs that respond to user input and solve real-life problems.

## 📚 Theory Concepts Covered

### 🔹 If–Else Statements
- Making decisions based on conditions
- Handling multiple cases using `elif`

### 🔹 Comparison Operators
- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

### 🔹 Loops
- `for` loop – repeat tasks a fixed number of times
- `while` loop – repeat until a condition is met

### 🔹 Functions
- Creating reusable blocks of code
- Passing parameters and returning values

### 🔹 Basic Error Awareness
- Understanding common runtime issues
- Writing safer input-based programs

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice

✔ Program that displays messages based on time of day  
✔ Number guessing game using if-else and loops  
✔ Print numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop  
✔ Function to calculate area of a rectangle  
✔ Simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
✔ Real-life logic programs:

## 🎯 Mini Project: Student Grade Calculator

### 📌 Project Description
A Python program that:
- Takes student marks as input
- Calculates the grade (A, B, C, D, F)
- Displays an encouraging message for each grade

### 🧠 Skills Used
- If–else conditions  
- User input handling  
- Variables  
- Clean output formatting
